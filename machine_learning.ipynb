    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "- Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves training algorithms to make predictions or decisions based on data.\n",
    "- Machine learning allows machine to learn and make decisions smarlty. \n",
    "- It can learn from teh data, which is already machines have or provided them to proceed with.\n",
    "- It depends upon the type of machine learning. \n",
    "- In machine learning process, we provide Data then we train the model, then we test the model and finally we deploy the model. Further, we can predict from this process to find unkonwn. \n",
    "- There are four major process:\n",
    "  1. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "  2. Learning \n",
    "  3. Predction \n",
    "  4. Decision \n",
    "- Machine learning is used in many applications such as image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, and more.\n",
    "- Machine learning, Deep Learning and Generative AI are the sub branches of Artificial Intelligence.\n",
    "- The advance type of AI is ML, advnace type of ML is DL and further advance type of DL is GAI.\n",
    "    - Articial Intelligence: AI, is the ability of a machine to perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence. OR engineering of making intelligent machines and programms on teh basis of the Data. \n",
    "    - Machine Learning: ML, is a subset of AI that involves training algorithms to make predictions or decisions based on data. OR ability to learn withou explicitly programmed.\n",
